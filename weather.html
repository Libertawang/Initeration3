            <div class="desc">
                <p>The rainfall is what determines the weather in Indonesia. Indonesia is split by the equator, and therefore has a tropical climate throughout the year. The average temperature over the entire courtry is 28Â°C. The only 2 seasons are Rainy
                    and Dry Season.</p><br><br></div>

                    <h3>Bali</h3>
                    <p>Bali attracts a lot of tourists every year with the help of its wild beaches. Most of the rainfall is received between November and March. The rains are usually followed by sunny clear skies. The best time to visit Bali is between
                        April and September when it is the sunniest making the time spent at the beach swimming and surfing wonderful!!

                    <h3>Java</h3>
                    <p>Java is one of the most captivating islands in Indonesia. It is pretty dry and hot during the months April to October. This is the best time to visit Java for watching the sun rise over giant buddhas and rumbling Bromo (the Volcanos)
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sumatra</h3>
                    <p>Sumatra has a hot and humid tropical climate. That said, the monsoons are extreme and lead to potholed and unpaved roads. This makes hiking extremely difficult. Therefore, the best time to visit Sumatra is between May and June or September
                        and October when its neither too hot nor heavy rainfall. Orangutans are fairly common.

                    <h3>Nusa Tenggara</h3>
                    <p>The difference between the dry and wet seasons are slightly bigger in this region. As a rule of thumb, the closer to Autralia you are, the longer the dry season. Dry months are between April and September which is the favourable time
                        to vist to embrace their sunshine and blue skies at the white beaches.
